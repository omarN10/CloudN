Write a function validAnagram that takes in two strings, str1 and str2,
and returns a boolean indicating whether or not str1 is an anagram of str2. 
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Implement function example

Name:         valid anagram

Assumptions:     indicating whether or not str1 is an anagram of str2   //expected context from the function


Inputs:         //what is Inputs

Processes:        //specifies what should the function do like (validation)
              

outputs:               // expected output of the function like(array, variables)
