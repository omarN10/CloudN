Write a function validAnagram that takes in two strings, str1 and str2,
and returns a boolean indicating whether or not str1 is an anagram of str2. 
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Implement function example

Name:         valid anagram

Assumptions:     indicating whether or not str1 is an anagram of str2   //expected context from the function


Inputs:         str1, str2

Processes:    1. validates the lengths of two strings        //specifies what should the function do like (validation)
              2. create two frequency objects of the two strings
              3. loop to check if the two object of the same key are same

outputs:    boolean           // expected output of the function like(array, variables)
